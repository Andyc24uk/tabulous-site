<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
Tabulous is designed with privacy as a core principle.
We do not collect, transmit, store, or sell any personal data.
</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>

<p>
Tabulous does not collect any personal information, browsing history,
or identifiable user data.
</p>

<p>
All workspace data (such as workspace names, colors, and tab URLs)
is stored locally on your device using Chrome’s built-in storage APIs.
This data never leaves your browser.
</p>

<h2>Data Usage</h2>

<p>
The data stored by Tabulous is used solely to provide its core functionality,
including organizing workspaces, restoring windows, and recovering sessions
after unexpected browser shutdowns.
</p>

<p>
Tabulous does not analyze, share, or transmit this data in any way.
</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>
Tabulous requires certain Chrome permissions to function correctly:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Tabs and Windows</strong> – to organize, move, and restore browser tabs and windows.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Storage</strong> – to save workspace information locally on your device.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Alarms</strong> – to periodically save recovery snapshots so your workspaces
    can be restored in the event of a browser crash or unexpected shutdown.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These permissions are used only for core functionality and never for tracking,
analytics, or advertising.
</p>

<h2>Third Parties</h2>

<p>
Tabulous does not use third-party analytics, tracking services,
advertising networks, or external APIs.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>
All data remains on your local device and can be removed at any time
by uninstalling the extension.
</p>
